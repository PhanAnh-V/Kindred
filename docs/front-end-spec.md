## Personality Assessment Design

### Question Framework

**Core Innovation:** Combine scientifically-validated HEXACO personality measurement with relatable hobby scenarios that create instant conversation starters and reduce assessment anxiety.

### Example Questions by HEXACO Dimension

#### 1. Extraversion (Social Energy & Enthusiasm)
**Scenario:** "You discover a tiny café that serves 47 different types of matcha, but it's hidden in a basement with no sign."

**Options:**
- A) **Keep it as your secret study spot** *(Low Extraversion)*
- B) **Bring your best friend next week** *(Medium-Low)*
- C) **Post about it in your class group chat** *(Medium-High)*
- D) **Start a "Hidden Tokyo Spots" Instagram account** *(High Extraversion)*

*Conversation Starter Created: "Wait, you also hunt for hidden cafés?!"*

#### 2. Agreeableness (Cooperation & Trust)
**Scenario:** "Your friend asks you to co-create a manga together, but they want the main character to have a completely different personality than what you envisioned."

**Options:**
- A) **Insist your character concept is better** *(Low Agreeableness)*
- B) **Suggest combining both ideas somehow** *(Medium)*
- C) **Go with their idea to keep peace** *(Medium-High)*
- D) **Get excited about their creative vision** *(High Agreeableness)*

*Conversation Starter: "You also draw manga?! What style?"*

### Assessment Interaction Design

**Visual Presentation:**
- Clean, card-based layout with soft shadows
- Each scenario presented as short, engaging story

**UX Flow per Question:**
1. **Scenario Introduction:** "Imagine this situation..."
2. **Visual Context:** Simple illustration or icon
3. **Response Selection:** "What would you most likely do?"
4. **Gentle Affirmation:** "Interesting choice! Let's explore more..."
5. **Progress:** Dot indicator showing journey completion
