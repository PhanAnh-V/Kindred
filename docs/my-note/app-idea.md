(I need advice on this one, I am just going to use security auth from database, vercel for deployment, and integate stripe for payment, but those are just what i know that there is. Depend on the complexity of the app I will follow the advice from AI to how to manage the app bacnkend)
### 4.3 Data Models

#### User Model

```javascript
{
  id: string,
  password: string,
  creatorId: string,
  title: string,
  status: 'active' | 'completed',
  guests: [Guest],
  groups: [Group],
  createdAt: Date,
  expiresAt: Date
}
```

#### Guest Model
