If we have selectable answers, then when we  │
│   use the AI to group people           │
│   together, I don't think it is going  │
│   to be good. When students have       │
│   stories about themselves to tell     │
│   the AI, and when the AI groups them  │
│   together, they are going to have a   │
│   better answer. For example, if now   │
│   I group four people together, and    │
│   they have kind of  │
│  kind of similar answers. In      │
│   that group page, there will be some  │
│   kind of text that said why are       │
│   they a group. When we have the       │
│   typing answer, it is going to be     │
│   better than the selectable one, this is just my theory.
Do we have a sucessful app out there that is doing what we do here? can u use the MCP tools and search for me?.
