# ConnectClass Question Design Methodology

## Design Process & Standards Documentation

### **Core Design Philosophy**

The ConnectClass questions were designed using a **Dual-Purpose Framework**:
1. **Scientific Validity:** Measure HEXACO personality dimensions with statistical reliability
2. **Social Catalyst:** Create authentic conversation starters and shared interest discovery

### **Step-by-Step Question Creation Process**

#### **Phase 1: HEXACO Dimension Mapping**
Each question must clearly measure one of six personality dimensions:

**Target Behaviors per Dimension:**
- **Honesty-Humility (H):** Fairness, modesty, greed-avoidance, sincerity
- **Emotionality (E):** Anxiety, fearfulness, dependence, sentimentality  
- **Extraversion (X):** Social boldness, sociability, liveliness, expressiveness
- **Agreeableness (A):** Patience, tolerance, gentleness, flexibility
- **Conscientiousness (C):** Organization, diligence, perfectionism, prudence
- **Openness (O):** Aesthetic appreciation, inquisitiveness, creativity, unconventionality

#### **Phase 2: Scenario Selection Criteria**

**Universal Relevance Test:**
- ✅ Will this scenario be relevant in 5-10 years?
- ✅ Does it translate across different cultural moments?
- ✅ Can students from different backgrounds relate to it?

**Weird Hobby Integration:**
- ✅ Does it involve niche interests that create excitement when shared?
- ✅ Is it specific enough to be memorable but broad enough to be accessible?
- ✅ Does it avoid stereotypes while embracing authentic quirks?

**Conversation Catalyst Check:**
- ✅ Will this create genuine "wait, you do that too?!" moments?
- ✅ Does it provide natural follow-up questions for ice-breakers?
- ✅ Is it engaging enough to discuss for 2-3 minutes?

#### **Phase 3: Response Option Design**

**Scientific Calibration:**
Each option maps to a 1-4 scale on the target dimension:
- **Option A:** Low trait expression (score: 1)
- **Option B:** Medium-low trait expression (score: 2)  
- **Option C:** Medium-high trait expression (score: 3)
- **Option D:** High trait expression (score: 4)

**Authenticity Standards:**
- All options must be realistic responses real students would choose
- No "obviously right" answers that create social desirability bias
- Options should reflect natural personality variation, not moral judgments

### **Example: Question Development Walkthrough**

**Target Dimension:** Extraversion (social energy, enthusiasm for interaction)

**Step 1: Behavior Identification**
- Low X: Prefers solitude, keeps discoveries private
- High X: Shares experiences, seeks social engagement

**Step 2: Scenario Brainstorming**
- Initial ideas: "finding a new restaurant," "discovering a hobby," "learning about something cool"
- Selected: "Hidden café discovery" (timeless, universally relatable, creates clear sharing vs. privacy choice)

**Step 3: Scenario Crafting**
"You discover a hidden café that serves 47 different types of tea, but it's in a basement with no sign and you're the only customer."

**Design Rationale:**
- **"Hidden café"** = universally appealing discovery
- **"47 types of tea"** = specific detail that feels special and worth sharing
- **"Basement with no sign"** = emphasizes the secretive, exclusive nature
- **"Only customer"** = sets up the sharing vs. keeping private decision

**Step 4: Response Option Calibration**

- **A) Keep it as your secret study spot** → Low X (1): Clear preference for solitude
- **B) Bring your closest friend next week** → Med-Low X (2): Limited sharing with trusted person  
- **C) Tell your friend group about this amazing find** → Med-High X (3): Moderate social sharing
- **D) Start a 'Hidden Spots' social media account** → High X (4): Maximum social energy and public sharing

**Step 5: Conversation Starter Integration**
"Do you prefer discovering places alone or sharing them immediately?" 
- Creates natural discussion about exploration styles
- Allows group members to share similar discovery stories
- Provides ongoing conversation material during ice-breaker activities

**Step 6: Cultural Adaptation Check**
- ✅ Works across cultures (cafés exist globally)
- ✅ No specific cultural references that might become outdated
- ✅ Respects Japanese preferences for both harmony (sharing) and privacy (keeping secrets)

### **Quality Assurance Standards**

#### **Statistical Validation Requirements**
- **Correlation with validated HEXACO items:** r ≥ .50
- **Internal consistency within dimension:** α ≥ .70 when combined with other questions
- **Test-retest reliability:** r ≥ .70 over 2-4 week period
- **Cross-cultural validity:** Similar factor structure across Japanese and international samples

#### **Engagement Validation Requirements**  
- **Student interest rating:** ≥ 4.0/5.0 ("This question was interesting")
- **Conversation starter effectiveness:** ≥ 75% of groups discuss the scenario during ice-breakers
- **Cultural appropriateness:** ≥ 95% approval from Japanese cultural consultants
- **Memorability:** ≥ 60% of students can recall specific scenarios 1 week later

#### **Technical Implementation Standards**
- **Response time:** < 30 seconds average per question
- **Completion rate:** ≥ 90% of students finish entire assessment
- **Data quality:** < 5% straight-line responding or pattern responses
- **Mobile optimization:** Clear display on devices ≥ 5-inch screens

### **Future Modification Framework**

#### **When to Update Questions**

**Immediate Update Triggers:**
- Student engagement drops below 4.0/5.0 rating
- Completion rates fall below 85%
- Cultural consultants flag content as inappropriate
- Statistical validity measures fall below thresholds

**Scheduled Review Cycles:**
- **Annual Review:** Check engagement metrics, cultural relevance
- **Bi-Annual Deep Dive:** Statistical validation, cross-cultural testing
- **5-Year Overhaul:** Major scenario updates while maintaining measurement validity

#### **Safe Modification Process**

**Level 1: Surface Changes (Low Risk)**
- Adjust specific details within scenarios (tea types, collection items)
- Modify wording for clarity while maintaining meaning
- Update cultural references within same category

**Level 2: Scenario Replacement (Medium Risk)**  
- Replace entire scenario while measuring same dimension
- Requires A/B testing against original for validity
- Must maintain conversation starter effectiveness

**Level 3: Dimension Restructure (High Risk)**
- Change fundamental measurement approach
- Requires full psychometric validation study
- Should be coordinated with major system updates

### **Content Management System Requirements**

#### **Version Control Standards**
- All questions tagged with creation date, version number
- A/B testing capabilities for scenario comparisons  
- Rollback functionality to previous validated versions
- Change tracking with justification documentation

#### **Cultural Adaptation Pipeline**
- Translation management for multiple languages
- Cultural consultant approval workflow
- Regional customization options (urban vs. rural scenarios)
- Feedback collection system for ongoing cultural validation

#### **Analytics Integration**
- Real-time engagement tracking per question
- Conversation starter effectiveness measurement
- Cultural appropriateness monitoring
- Statistical validity continuous monitoring

This methodology ensures questions remain scientifically valid while creating authentic social connections, with clear processes for safe future evolution.
