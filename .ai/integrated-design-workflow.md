## Implementation Process

### **Phase 1: Visual Design with SuperDesign**
1. Use the simple prompts above to create clean layouts
2. Focus on clarity and usability over visual complexity
3. Get working HTML/CSS that prioritizes accessibility
4. Test with users for feedback

### **Phase 2: Component Implementation**
1. Use Shadcn components for production-ready implementation
2. Maintain the clean design while improving code quality
3. Ensure all accessibility features are preserved
4. Focus on performance and mobile optimization

### **Phase 3: Cultural Validation**
1. Test with Japanese users for cultural appropriateness
2. Ensure the simple design still feels respectful and appropriate
3. Adjust messaging and visual elements based on feedback
4. Validate anxiety-reduction goals

## Benefits of Simple Design
✅ **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Students can focus on the assessment
