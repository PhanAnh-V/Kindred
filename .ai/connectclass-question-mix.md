## Assessment Implementation Notes

### Question Selection Strategy
- **2 questions per HEXACO dimension** provides backup options and improves reliability
- **Teachers can customize** which version to use based on class culture/timing
- **Cultural localization** can swap scenarios while maintaining personality measurement validity

### Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
// Each question maps to HEXACO dimensions
const scoringMatrix = {
  honesty_humility: [q1_score, q2_score],
  emotionality: [q3_score, q4_score],
  extraversion: [q5_score, q6_score],
  agreeableness: [q7_score, q8_score],
  conscientiousness: [q9_score, q10_score],
  openness: [q11_score, q12_score]
};

// Average scores per dimension for FCM clustering
const hexacoProfile = dimensions.map(scores => 
  scores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0) / scores.length
);
```

### Conversation Starter Integration
Each question's "Conversation Starter" becomes part of the AI-generated ice-breaker activities, creating natural discussion points based on shared scenario responses.

This design balances scientific validity with engagement while creating authentic connection opportunities that will remain relevant regardless of cultural trends.
